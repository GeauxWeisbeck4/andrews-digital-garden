- # October 5th, 2024 - Saturday
	- Today I need to get back on track, especially with the learning. I think a good place to start will be the digital garden where I can work in public and share ideas more so in a way I want to than what I have ever done before. It will be a good way to show people what I am working on and that I am staying productive and becoming a better developer each day. I also need to get some content pushed out today - it's been too long since I've made that a priority and today is the perfect kind of content writing day that I've needed for quite some time. I thin today will be a positive day overall and that I will get some good things done that have been needed to get done for a long time. The Huskers will win, Go Big Fuckin Red!
