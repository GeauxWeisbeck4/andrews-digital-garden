# Introduction

We've already mentioned that data structures and algorithms are used to write efficient and scalable code.

Now, let's see a simple example of this.

# Sum of Natural Numbers

We can create a program to find the sum of natural numbers using a `for` loop.

```python
def calculate_sum(n):        total = 0        for i in range(n+1):        total += i        return total    result = calculate_sum(100)print(result)    # 5050
```

Run Code  >>

In most cases, this program won't cause any problems.

However, what if we have to find the sum of natural numbers of an absurdly large number, let's say **10000000000**?

It will take a lot of time and memory to find the sum for this number.

Next, we will solve this problem in a more optimized manner.

# Optimized: Sum of Natural Numbers

We can find the sum of natural numbers using a simple formula:

```
Sum of natural numbers=n∗(n+1)2Sum of natural numbers=2n∗(n+1)​
```

Let's use this formula to find the sum of natural numbers.

```python
def calculate_sum(n):    return n * (n + 1) // 2    result = calculate_sum(100)print(result)    # 5050
```

Run Code  >>

This program runs in a fraction of a second, even for very large numbers. It's because we solved this problem with a single instruction, regardless of the size of the input.

# Takeaway

If we didn't know the formula to find the sum of natural numbers, we wouldn't have been able to solve the problem efficiently.

**Does that mean DSA is all about mathematics?**

Absolutely not.

We gave this example to emphasize the necessity of optimizing our code, especially for tasks that involve large numbers of calculations.

As you can see, a small change in approach can lead to a significant improvement in efficiency.

Understanding and applying optimization techniques can save a significant amount of computational time and resources. It is an essential skill for any programmer aiming to write scalable and efficient code.

By learning data structures and algorithms, you will acquire the ability to recognize opportunities for optimization and develop skills to implement them in your program.
