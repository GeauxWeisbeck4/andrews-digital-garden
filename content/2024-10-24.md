- # October 24, 2024 - Thursday
	- Today is going to be an important day in regards to my job search. I am going to apply for at least 20 jobs and tailor each application to the specific job requirements and company culture. I will also reach out to my network for any potential job leads or referrals. Additionally, I will update my resume and LinkedIn profile to highlight my skills and experiences effectively. Finally, I will set specific goals for follow-up actions after submitting each application to maintain  a proactive approach in my job search. This comprehensive strategy will help me maximize my chances of securing a new job opportunity. I am also going to hit my roadmaps hard today and spend time optimizing each note and building my first set of flash cards as well to prepare for interviews. Leet Code, Hackerrank, and Codewar problems are also going to get a lot of attention. In addition, I will make sure to research each company thoroughly and customize my cover letter for each application. This personalized approach will demonstrate my genuine interest and enthusiasm for each potential opportunity.
