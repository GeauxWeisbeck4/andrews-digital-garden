# Keys

In chapter one, we saw how Preact uses a Virtual DOM to calculate what changed between two trees described by our JSX, then applies those changes to the HTML DOM to update pages. This works well for most scenarios, but occasionally requires that Preact "guesses" how the shape of the tree has changed between two renders.

The most common scenario where Preact's guess is likely to be different than our intent is when comparing lists. Consider a simple to-do list component:

```jsx
export default function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(['wake up', 'make bed'])

  function wakeUp() {
    setTodos(['make bed'])
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {todos.map(todo => (
          <li>{todo}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <button onClick={wakeUp}>I'm Awake!</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The first time this component is rendered, twoÂ `<li>`Â list items will be drawn. After clicking theÂ **"I'm Awake!"**Â button, ourÂ `todos`Â state Array is updated to contain only the second item,Â `"make bed"`.

Here's what Preact "sees" for the first and second renders:

|First Render|Second Render|
|---|---|
|```jsx<br><div><br>  <ul><br>    <li>wake up</li><br>    <li>make bed</li><br>  </ul><br>  <button>I'm Awake!</button><br></div><br>```|```jsx<br><div><br>  <ul><br>    <li>make bed</li><br><br>  </ul><br>  <button>I'm Awake!</button><br></div><br>```|

Notice a problem? While it's clear to us that theÂ _first_Â list item ("wake up") was removed, Preact doesn't know that. All Preact sees is that there were two items, and now there is one. When applying this update, it will actually remove the second item (`<li>make bed</li>`), then update the text of the first item fromÂ `wake up`Â toÂ `make bed`.

The result is technically correct â€“ a single item with the text "make bed" â€“ the way we arrived at that result was suboptimal. Imagine if there were 1000 list items and we removed the first item: instead of removing a singleÂ `<li>`, Preact would update the text of the first 999 other items and remove the last one.

### TheÂ **key**Â to list rendering

In situations like the previous example, items are changingÂ _order_. We need a way to help Preact know which items are which, so it can detect when each item is added, removed or replaced. To do this, we can add aÂ `key`Â prop to each item.

TheÂ `key`Â prop is an identifier for a given element. Instead of comparing theÂ _order_Â of elements between two trees, elements with aÂ `key`Â prop are compared by finding the previous element with that sameÂ `key`Â prop value. AÂ `key`Â can be any type of value, as long as it is "stable" between renders: repeated renders of the same item should have the exact sameÂ `key`Â prop value.

Let's add keys to the previous example. Since our todo list is a simple Array of strings that don't change, we can use those strings as keys:

```jsx
export default function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(['wake up', 'make bed'])

  function wakeUp() {
    setTodos(['make bed'])
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {todos.map(todo => (
          <li key={todo}>{todo}</li>
          //  ^^^^^^^^^^ adding a key prop
        ))}
      </ul>
      <button onClick={wakeUp}>I'm Awake!</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The first time we render this new version of theÂ `<TodoList>`Â component, twoÂ `<li>`Â items will be drawn. When clicking the "I'm Awake!" button, ourÂ `todos`Â state Array is updated to contain only the second item,Â `"make bed"`.

Here's what Preact sees now that we've addedÂ `key`Â to the list items:

|First Render|Second Render|
|---|---|
|```jsx<br><div><br>  <ul><br>    <li key="wake up">wake up</li><br>    <li key="make bed">make bed</li><br>  </ul><br>  <button>I'm Awake!</button><br></div><br>```|```jsx<br><div><br>  <ul><br><br>    <li key="make bed">make bed</li><br>  </ul><br>  <button>I'm Awake!</button><br></div><br>```|

This time, Preact can see that the first item was removed, because the second tree is missing an item withÂ `key="wake up"`. It will remove the first item, and leave the second item untouched.

### WhenÂ **not**Â to use keys

One of the most common pitfalls developers encounter with keys is accidentally choosing keys that areÂ _unstable_Â between renders. In our example, imagine if we had used the index argument fromÂ `map()`Â as ourÂ `key`Â value rather than theÂ `item`Â string itself:

`items.map((item, index) => <li key={index}>{item}</li>`

This would result in Preact seeing the following trees on the first and second render:

|First Render|Second Render|
|---|---|
|```jsx<br><div><br>  <ul><br>    <li key={0}>wake up</li><br>    <li key={1}>make bed</li><br>  </ul><br>  <button>I'm Awake!</button><br></div><br>```|```jsx<br><div><br>  <ul><br><br>    <li key={0}>make bed</li><br>  </ul><br>  <button>I'm Awake!</button><br></div><br>```|

The problem is thatÂ `index`Â doesn't actually identify aÂ _**value**_Â in our list, it identifies aÂ _**position**_. Rendering this way actuallyÂ _forces_Â Preact to match items in-order, which is what it would have done if no keys were present. Using index keys can even force expensive or broken output when applied to list items with differing type, since keys cannot match elements with differing type.

> ðŸš™Â **Analogy Time!**Â Imagine you leave your car with a valet car park.
> 
> When you return to pick up your car, you tell the valet you drive a grey SUV. Unfortunately, over half of the parked cars are grey SUV's, and you end up with someone else's car. The next grey SUV owner gets the wrong one, and so on.
> 
> If you instead tell the valet you drive a grey SUV with the license plate "PR3ACT", you can be sure that your own car will be returned.

As a general rule of thumb, never use an Array or loop index as aÂ `key`. Use the list item value itself, or generate a unique ID for items and use that:

```jsx
const todos = [
  { id: 1, text: 'wake up' },
  { id: 2, text: 'make bed' }
]

export default function ToDos() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {todos.map(todo => (
        <li key={todo.id}>
          {todo.text}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

Remember: if you genuinely can't find a stable key, it's better to omit theÂ `key`Â prop entirely than to use an index as a key.

## Try it!

For this chapter's exercise, we'll combine what we learned about keys with our knowledge of side effects from the previous chapter.

Use an effect to call the providedÂ `getTodos()`Â function afterÂ `<TodoList>`Â is first rendered. Note that this function returns a Promise, which you can obtain the value of by callingÂ `.then(value => { })`. Once you have the Promise's value, store it in theÂ `todos`Â useState hook by calling its associatedÂ `setTodos`Â method.

Finally, update the JSX to render each item fromÂ `todos`Â as anÂ `<li>`Â containing that todo item'sÂ `.text`Â property value.
## Example
```jsx
import { render } from 'preact';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'preact/hooks';

const wait = ms => new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, ms))

const getTodos = async () => {
  await wait(500);
  return [
    { id: 1, text: 'learn Preact', done: false },
    { id: 2, text: 'make an awesome app', done: false },
  ]
}

function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([])

  useEffect(() => {
    getTodos().then(todos => {
      setTodos(todos)
    })
  }, [])

  return (
    <ul>
      {todos.map(todo => (
        <li key={todo.id}>
          {todo.text}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

render(<TodoList />, document.getElementById("app"));
```
