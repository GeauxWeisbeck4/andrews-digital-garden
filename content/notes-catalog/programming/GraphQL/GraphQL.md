# What is GraphQL? 

GraphQL, according to crystallize.com

- GraphQL is a specification that describes a declarative query language in which web and mobile clients can ask an [application programming interface (API)](https://crystallize.com/learn/concepts/api) for the exact data they want. Everything Crystallize does is powered by GraphQL APIs.

## GraphQL Core Concepts

**Schema: **the center of GraphQL implementation. It describes the functionality available to the clients that are connecting to it.

**SDL: **Schema Definition Language, or SDL, is the type system that’s used to define the schema of an API.

**Query**: an API request made by the client machine application. It supports augments and points to arrays. A query is used to read or fetch values.

**Mutation: **a way to change the dataset in GraphQL. It modifies data in the data store and returns a value. Mutations help you to insert, update, or delete data.

## GraphQL vs REST

GraphQL and REST have several differences. Here is a list of the most important. 

**Characteristics of REST:**

* Fast client-side requirements are not well suited to REST's static nature.
* Queries are made at various endpoints (URL).
* Downloading unnecessary information.
* Several endpoints (URL) must be consulted to obtain the information that is being sought.

**Characteristics of GraphQL:**

* Single endpoint (URL).
* GraphQL uses a strongly-typed system to define the capabilities of an API.
* Schemas serve as a contract between the client and the server.
* The frontend and backend can work completely independently.
