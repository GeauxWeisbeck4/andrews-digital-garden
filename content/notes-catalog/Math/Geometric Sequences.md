# Geometric Sequences
- Let's say a company earns $100 the first year, they double by the end of the year. They consistently double their profits each year with fixed multiples.
```
yr 1 - $100
yr2 - $200
yr3 - $400
yr4 - $800
fixed multiple, r - 2
```
What if we want fixed multiple r = 3
```
yr1 - 50
yr2 - 150
yr3 - 450
```

What if we want to figure out the companies profits 600 years into the future?

a(subn)  = a(sub1) * r*(n - 1) <- exponent

Instagram influencer has 50 followers - they are going to double it every month what will it be after 10 months?
```
50 ^ 2 ^ (9)
followers = 50 * 512
followers = 25,600
```
