- Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope. Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program. Variables declared with `var`, `let` and `const` are quite similar when declared outside a block.

## Note

If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared i.e `potato = true` it will automatically become a _GLOBAL_ variable.
