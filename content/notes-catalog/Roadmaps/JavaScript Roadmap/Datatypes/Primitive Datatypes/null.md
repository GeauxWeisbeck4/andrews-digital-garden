# null

The `null` value in JavaScript signifies the deliberate absence of any object value. It is considered as one of JavaScript’s primitive values and a `falsy` value.

_Deliberate absence_ emphasises the intentional use of `null` to indicate that a variable does not point to any object. This explicit declaration conveys the purposeful nature of null, showing that the variable is meant to be empty or non-existent at execution time.

In essence, `null` is a way to reset a variable, signalling that it should not reference any object.
