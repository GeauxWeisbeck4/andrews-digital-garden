# Basics of SEO
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) basics involve strategies to improve a website’s visibility and ranking in search engine results. Key elements include creating relevant, high-quality content, proper use of keywords, optimizing meta tags and URLs, ensuring mobile-friendliness, improving site speed, and building quality backlinks. SEO also focuses on user experience, including easy navigation and responsive design. Technical aspects like XML sitemaps, HTTPS security, and structured data markup play crucial roles. Understanding user intent, regularly updating content, and adhering to search engine guidelines are essential practices. Effective SEO combines on-page optimization, off-page tactics, and technical enhancements to increase organic traffic, improve user engagement, and enhance online presence in an increasingly competitive digital landscape.

# Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML markup to reinforce the meaning of web content, rather than merely defining its appearance. It involves using HTML elements that clearly describe their purpose and content. Semantic HTML improves accessibility, SEO, and code readability. Key elements include `%3Cheader%3E`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`. It also encompasses using appropriate heading levels (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`,`<li>`), and data tables (`<table>`, `<th>`, `<td>`). Semantic HTML helps screen readers interpret page content, enables better browser rendering, and provides clearer structure for developers. By using semantically correct elements, developers create more meaningful, accessible, and maintainable web documents that are easier for both humans and machines to understand and process.
