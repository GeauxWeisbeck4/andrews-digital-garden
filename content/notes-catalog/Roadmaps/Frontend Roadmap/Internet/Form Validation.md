# Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML markup to reinforce the meaning of web content, rather than merely defining its appearance. It involves using HTML elements that clearly describe their purpose and content. Semantic HTML improves accessibility, SEO, and code readability. Key elements include `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`. It also encompasses using appropriate heading levels (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`,`<li>`), and data tables (`<table>`, `<th>`, `<td>`). Semantic HTML helps screen readers interpret page content, enables better browser rendering, and provides clearer structure for developers. By using semantically correct elements, developers create more meaningful, accessible, and maintainable web documents that are easier for both humans and machines to understand and process.
