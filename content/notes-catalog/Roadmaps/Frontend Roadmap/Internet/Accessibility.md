[Accessibility
Website accessibility is the practice of designing and developing websites that can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities. It involves implementing features and standards that make web content perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for all users, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities. This includes providing text alternatives for images, ensuring keyboard navigation, using sufficient color contrast, offering captions for audio content, and creating a consistent and predictable layout. Adhering to accessibility guidelines not only improves usability for people with disabilities but also enhances the overall user experience for all visitors while potentially increasing a site’s reach and legal compliance.

# Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML markup to reinforce the meaning of web content, rather than merely defining its appearance. It involves using HTML elements that clearly describe their purpose and content. Semantic HTML improves accessibility, SEO, and code readability. Key elements include `%3Cheader%3E`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`. It also encompasses using appropriate heading levels (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`,`<li>`), and data tables (`<table>`, `<th>`, `<td>`). Semantic HTML helps screen readers interpret page content, enables better browser rendering, and provides clearer structure for developers. By using semantically correct elements, developers create more meaningful, accessible, and maintainable web documents that are easier for both humans and machines to understand and process.
