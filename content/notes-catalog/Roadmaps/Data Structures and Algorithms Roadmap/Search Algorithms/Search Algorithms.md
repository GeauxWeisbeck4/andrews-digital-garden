# Search Algorithms

Search algorithms are techniques used for finding a specific item or group of items among a collection of data. The primary types of search algorithms are linear search, binary search, depth-first search, and breadth-first search. Linear and binary search are explained in this section. The other two types in a next section of this roadmap.
