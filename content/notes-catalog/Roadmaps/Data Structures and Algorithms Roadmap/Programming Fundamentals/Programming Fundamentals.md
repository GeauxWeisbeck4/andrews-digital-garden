# Programming Fundamentals

Programming Fundamentals are the basic concepts and principles that form the foundation of any computer programming language. These include understanding variables, which store data for processing, control structures such as loops and conditional statements that direct the flow of a program, data structures which organize and store data efficiently, and algorithms which step by step instructions to solve specific problems or perform specific tasks. Mastery of these fundamentals forms the basis for learning any specific programming language and for writing efficient, effective code.

# Language Syntax

Language syntax refers to the set of rules that dictate how programs written in a particular programming language must be structured. This can include rules for how to declare variables, how to call functions, how to structure control flow statements, and so on. Syntax varies significantly between different programming languages, so it is critical to grasp the specific syntax of the language you are using. It’s similar to grammar in human languages - putting words in the wrong order or including extraneous punctuation can make a sentence hard to understand, and the same applies to programming. Incorrect syntax leads to syntax errors which prevent your code from executing.

Learn the language syntax of the programming language you are using.

# Control Structures

Control structures are fundamental elements in most programming languages that facilitate the flow of control through a program. There are three main types of control structures: Sequential, Selection and Iteration.

- **Sequential** control structures are the default mode where instructions happen one after another.
- **Selection** control structures (often called “conditional” or “decision” structures) allow one set of instructions to be executed if a condition is true and another if it’s false. These typically include `if...else` statements.
- **Iteration** control structures (also known as _loops_) allow a block of code to be repeated multiple times. Common loop structures include `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops. All these control structures play a vital role in shaping the program logic.

# Functions

Functions in programming are named sections of a program that perform a specific task. They allow us to write a piece of code once and reuse it in different places throughout the program, making our code more modular and easier to maintain. Functions often take in input, do something with it, and return output. Functions can be categorized into four main types:

- **Built-in** functions: provided by the programming language, like `print()` in Python.
- **User-defined** functions: written by the user for a specific use case.
- **Anonymous** functions: also known as lambda functions, which are not declared using the standard keyword (`def` in Python, for example).
- **Higher-order** functions: functions that take other functions as arguments or return a function.

# OOP Basics

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses “objects” to design applications and software. In OOP, each object is an instance of a class. A class defines the properties (often known as attributes or fields) and methods (actions) that are common to all objects of a certain kind. A key principle of OOP is the ability to hide certain parts of the objects’ data from the outside, a concept known as encapsulation. Other key principles are inheritance, a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined, and polymorphism, the concept of designing objects to share behaviors and being able to override shared behaviors with specifics.


# Pseudo Code

Pseudo code is a plain language description of the steps in an algorithm or another system. It is intended for human reading rather than machine reading. Pseudo code often uses control structures and terms common to popular high-level programming languages without strictly adhering to the syntax of any particular one. The foremost aim of pseudocode is to explain the inner “algorithmic thinking” behind coding, rather than focusing on the syntax of a particular language. A nice feature of pseudocode is that it is largely able to be understood by a wider range of people than the corresponding code in a specific programming language, which enhances its roles in drafting, documentation, learning, and collaboration aspects.
