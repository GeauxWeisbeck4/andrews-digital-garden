# Complex Data Structures

Complex data structures are advanced structures that are used for storing and organizing data in a more specialized way to manage larger amounts of data more effectively. These include Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, and Heaps. Trees allow for hierarchical data structures and can be utilized in many ways like Binary Trees, AVL Trees etc. Graphs are networks consisting of nodes or vertices, connected by edges. Hash Tables use a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Heaps are a special case of a binary tree where the parent nodes are compared to their children with specific rules.
