# Divide and Conquer

Divide and conquer is a powerful algorithm design technique that solves a problem by breaking it down into smaller and easier-to-manage sub-problems, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. This approach is usually carried out recursively for most problems. Once all the sub-problems are solved, the solutions are combined to give a solution to the original problem. It is a common strategy that significantly reduces the complexity of the problem.
