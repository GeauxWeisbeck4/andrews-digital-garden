# Tree Traversal

Tree Traversal is a method of visiting all the nodes in a tree data structure. There are three main types of tree traversal, these include Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder. Preorder traversal visits the current node before its child nodes, Inorder traversal visits the left child, then the parent and right child, and Postorder traversal visits the children before their respective parents. There’s also a level order traversal which visits nodes level by level. Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS) are two popular algorithms used for tree traversal. DFS involves exhaustive searches of nodes by going forward if possible and if it is not possible then by going back. BFS starts traversal from the root node and visits nodes in a level by level manner.
