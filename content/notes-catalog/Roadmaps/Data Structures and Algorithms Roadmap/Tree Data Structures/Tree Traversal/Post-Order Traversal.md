# Post-Order Traversal

Post Order Traversal is a technique used in Binary Tree structure where each node is processed after its child nodes. As the name suggests, it first traverses the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root node. The process is recursively repeated for each subtree until the entire tree has been traversed. This traversal method is often used for calculations that require that all child nodes be processed before the parent, such as evaluating a mathematical expression represented in a tree structure.
