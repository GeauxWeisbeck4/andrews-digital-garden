# Bash Scripts

Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a powerful Unix shell and command language interpreter, serving as the default shell for most Linux distributions and macOS. It provides a command-line interface for interacting with the operating system, executing commands, and automating tasks through shell scripts. Bash supports variables, control structures, functions, and command substitution, making it versatile for system administration, DevOps tasks, and general-purpose scripting. Its ability to pipe commands, redirect input/output, and utilize a vast array of built-in commands and utilities makes it an essential tool for developers and system administrators in managing and automating workflows in Unix-like environments.
