[Text Manipulation
Text manipulation tools are utilities or software that enable users to modify, process, and transform text data efficiently. These tools are often used in scripting, data cleaning, and automation tasks. Common text manipulation tools include sed (stream editor) for search and replace, awk for pattern scanning and data extraction, and grep for searching text using regular expressions. Other popular tools include cut, sort, tr, and uniq for various text processing functions. These command-line tools are commonly used in UNIX/Linux environments to handle large text files, automate workflows, and perform complex text transformations.

Performance monitoring is the systematic observation and measurement of an IT system’s operational efficiency and effectiveness. It involves collecting, analyzing, and reporting on key performance indicators (KPIs) across various components including applications, networks, servers, and databases. This process uses specialized tools to track metrics such as response time, throughput, resource utilization, and error rates. Performance monitoring helps identify bottlenecks, predict potential issues, and optimize system resources. It’s crucial for maintaining service level agreements (SLAs), ensuring user satisfaction, and supporting capacity planning. In modern IT environments, performance monitoring often incorporates real-time analytics, AI-driven insights, and automated alerting systems, enabling proactive management of complex, distributed systems and supporting continuous improvement in IT operations and service delivery.

Process monitoring is the continuous observation and analysis of processes within an IT system or organization to ensure optimal performance, efficiency, and compliance. It involves tracking key metrics, resource utilization, and behaviors of individual processes or applications running on a system. This practice helps identify anomalies, bottlenecks, or potential issues before they impact overall system performance or user experience. Process monitoring tools typically provide real-time data on CPU usage, memory consumption, I/O operations, and thread activity. They often include features for alerting, logging, and visualization of process data. In modern IT environments, process monitoring is crucial for maintaining system stability, optimizing resource allocation, troubleshooting performance issues, and supporting capacity planning in complex, distributed systems.
