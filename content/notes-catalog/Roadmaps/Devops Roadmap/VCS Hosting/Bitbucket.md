Bitbucket provides features such as pull requests, code reviews, CI/CD pipelines through Bitbucket Pipelines, and built-in wikis for documentation. It supports private repositories for free, making it popular among small teams and enterprises alike. With its focus on team collaboration, project management, and deployment automation, Bitbucket serves as a comprehensive platform for the entire software development lifecycle.
