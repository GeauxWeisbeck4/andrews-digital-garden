# RHEL / Derivatives
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is a popular distribution of the Linux operating system that is designed for enterprise-level use. It is developed and maintained by Red Hat, Inc., and it is available under a subscription-based model. There are several distributions of Linux that are based on RHEL, or that have been derived from RHEL in some way. These distributions are known as RHEL derivatives. Some examples of RHEL derivatives include: AlmaLinux, CentOS, CloudLinux, Oracle Linux, and Scientific Linux. RHEL derivatives are often used in enterprise environments because they offer the stability and reliability of RHEL, but with the added benefit of being free or lower-cost alternatives.

openSUSE is a Linux-based operating system known for its stability, versatility, and focus on user-friendly system management. It offers two main distributions: openSUSE Leap, a stable, enterprise-grade version with regular point releases, and openSUSE Tumbleweed, a rolling release version with the latest software updates. OpenSUSE is widely used by developers, system administrators, and enterprise environments due to its robust package management via Zypper and YaST (Yet another Setup Tool), which simplifies system configuration. It also supports a wide range of hardware and offers strong community-driven support.
