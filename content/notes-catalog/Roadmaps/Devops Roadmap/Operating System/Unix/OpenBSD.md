# OpenBSD
OpenBSD is a free, open-source Unix-like operating system known for its strong focus on security, code correctness, and proactive approach to eliminating vulnerabilities. It’s renowned for its stringent code review process, integrated cryptography, and default security features like stack protection and memory safeguards. OpenBSD pioneered many security innovations, including OpenSSH, and maintains a “secure by default” philosophy. The system is prized for its comprehensive documentation, clean and consistent codebase, and adherence to standards. While primarily used in server environments, especially for firewalls and network appliances, OpenBSD also supports desktop use. Its emphasis on security and stability makes it popular in high-security environments and among developers focused on system-level programming and network security.

FreeBSD is a free, open-source Unix-like operating system descended from the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). Known for its stability, performance, and advanced networking capabilities, FreeBSD is popular for server environments, embedded systems, and as a basis for network appliances. It features a monolithic kernel, a comprehensive set of userland utilities, and a ports collection for easy software installation. FreeBSD supports a wide range of architectures and includes advanced features like the ZFS file system, jails for containerization, and the pf packet filter. While less common in desktop environments, it’s widely used in internet infrastructure, storage systems, and by companies requiring a robust, customizable OS with a permissive license.
