# FreeBSD

FreeBSD is a free, open-source Unix-like operating system descended from the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). Known for its stability, performance, and advanced networking capabilities, FreeBSD is popular for server environments, embedded systems, and as a basis for network appliances. It features a monolithic kernel, a comprehensive set of userland utilities, and a ports collection for easy software installation. FreeBSD supports a wide range of architectures and includes advanced features like the ZFS file system, jails for containerization, and the pf packet filter. While less common in desktop environments, itâ€™s widely used in internet infrastructure, storage systems, and by companies requiring a robust, customizable OS with a permissive license.
