# LXC
LXC (Linux Containers) is an operating system-level virtualization method for running multiple isolated Linux systems on a single host using a single Linux kernel. It provides a lightweight alternative to full machine virtualization, offering near-native performance and density. LXC uses Linux kernel features like cgroups and namespaces to create containers that have their own process and network space, while sharing the same kernel as the host system. This technology allows for efficient resource utilization and rapid deployment of applications. LXC is often used for creating development environments, testing, and running multiple isolated services on a single machine. While similar in concept to Docker, LXC provides a more system-container approach compared to Dockerâ€™s application-container focus.

Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization technology. It enables developers to package applications with all their dependencies into standardized units called containers, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments. Docker provides a lightweight alternative to full machine virtualization, using OS-level virtualization to run multiple isolated systems on a single host. Its ecosystem includes tools for building, sharing, and running containers, such as Docker Engine, Docker Hub, and Docker Compose. Docker has become integral to modern DevOps practices, facilitating microservices architectures, continuous integration/deployment pipelines, and efficient resource utilization in both development and production environments.
