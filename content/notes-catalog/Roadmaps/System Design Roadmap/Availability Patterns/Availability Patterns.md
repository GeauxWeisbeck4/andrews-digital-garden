# Availability Patterns

Availability is measured as a percentage of uptime, and defines the proportion of time that a system is functional and working. Availability is affected by system errors, infrastructure problems, malicious attacks, and system load. Cloud applications typically provide users with a service level agreement (SLA), which means that applications must be designed and implemented to maximize availability.
