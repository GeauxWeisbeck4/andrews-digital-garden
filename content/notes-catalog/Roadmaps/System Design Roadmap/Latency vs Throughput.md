# Latency vs Throughput

Latency and throughput are two important measures of a system’s performance. **Latency** refers to the amount of time it takes for a system to respond to a request. **Throughput** refers to the number of requests that a system can handle at the same time.

Generally, you should aim for maximal throughput with acceptable latency.
