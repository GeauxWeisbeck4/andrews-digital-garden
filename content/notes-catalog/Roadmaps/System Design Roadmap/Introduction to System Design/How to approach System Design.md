There are several steps that can be taken when approaching a system design:

- **Understand the problem**: Gather information about the problem you are trying to solve and the requirements of the system. Identify the users and their needs, as well as any constraints or limitations of the system.
- **Identify the scope of the system:** Define the boundaries of the system, including what the system will do and what it will not do.
- **Research and analyze existing systems:** Look at similar systems that have been built in the past and identify what worked well and what didn’t. Use this information to inform your design decisions.
- **Create a high-level design:** Outline the main components of the system and how they will interact with each other. This can include a rough diagram of the system’s architecture, or a flowchart outlining the process the system will follow.
- **Refine the design:** As you work on the details of the design, iterate and refine it until you have a complete and detailed design that meets all the requirements.
- **Document the design:** Create detailed documentation of your design for future reference and maintenance.
- **Continuously monitor and improve the system:** The system design is not a one-time process, it needs to be continuously monitored and improved to meet the changing requirements.

Note that this is a general approach to System Design. For interview specific answers, see the following resources:
