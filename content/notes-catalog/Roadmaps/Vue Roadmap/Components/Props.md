- If we are building a blog, we will likely need a component representing a blog post. We want all the blog posts to share the same visual layout, but with different content. Such a component won’t be useful unless you can pass data to it, such as the title and content of the specific post we want to display. That’s where props come in.
- Props are custom attributes you can register on a component.
