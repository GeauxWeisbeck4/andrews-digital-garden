In Linux, navigation between directories and files is a fundamental, yet essential function that allows you to exploit the power of the command-line interface (CLI). Mastering the basic Linux navigation commands such as `cd`, `pwd`, `ls`, and `tree` enables you to flawlessly move from one point to another within the filesystem, display the list of files & directories, and understand your position relative to other system components.

Here is how you use these commands:

- To change directories, use the `cd` command:

```
cd /path/to/directory
```

- To list the contents of a directory, use the `ls` command:

```
ls
```
