# September 20, 2024 - Friday
- Today is Friday and I hope that it can be a good day - the Huskers play tonight versus Illinois  and they are both in the top 25 so it is going to be a tough game for us. We need to come ready to shut down their run and pass game as Bielema always seems to be able to get a pretty balanced attack going against us, especially. He gets those Hog molies on the offensive line to play at their highest potential, and that is what he does well overall in my opinion. I think the Huskers should win this game, but they need to play great d and shut down the balanced attack of Illinois. We'll need to blitz and hit the quarterback hard. Get Dylan going
