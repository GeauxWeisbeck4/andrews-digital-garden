## About Us

- Empowering Small Businesses Through Innovation and Hard Work
- At Tar Heel Dev Studio, we embody the spirit of North Carolina's rich history and the unwavering work ethic that defines it.
- Our name is inspired by the legendary early history of the residents who shaped the early economy of North Carolina. The state was a leader in producing tar, pitch, and turputine for the naval industry that was an important part of building America.
- Tar Heel was initially used as a derogatory term used to describe poor workers who worked in the shipyards and were known for their tenacity and for workin' so damn hard that tar stuck to their feet! You can't deny our work ethic or dedication to our craft when you have Tar Heels like Michael Jordan, Mia Hamm, and Maya Angelou.
