# August 23, 2024
- Today is going to be quite challenging to get going, but I need to settle in and try to get as locked in as I can be. I really need to rip through these Boot.dev courses and also start locking in on my resume because I'm getting contacted about jobs that I really could go in and probably do right now and get paid well to do. This morning page today will be brief, but hopefully I can hash out the clutter in my mind that I'm fending off.
- I'm abnormally tired today which is not ideal - had a late night (long story) but also didn't quite have my normal routine that I usually follow and that combination has caused me to struggle to get going so far today. I can't keep saying this enough, but I really need to focus on my resume first thing today. I can't keep delaying optimizing it and not applying for these jobs because getting a job is priority. I'm more than ready to start working and need to get my career back on track and also get into a more productive environment. Until I start making money, I don't think I will ever be motivated enough to hit my full potential.
- This book Deep Work is proving insightful for me right now. I need to take some time to read it today and pull some techniques from it. As an ADHD person, I really struggle with staying on task, motivation, and dealing with distractions. I think this is something anyone deals with, but it is just a whole different ballgame when you have ADHD. I have a hard time staying awake when trying to work and that sucks. But I'm hoping this morning pages each day can help me get some of the clutter out of my head and focus heavily on difficult tasks.
