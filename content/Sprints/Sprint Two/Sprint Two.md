# Sprint Two
- ## Sprint Two Week One
- ## [[Sprint Two Week Two]]

## Reflection
- ### Sprint Two Week One
	- Disorganized, but quite productive
- ### Sprint Two Week Two
	- Frustrating as far as productivity goes, but I laid a lot of the groundwork for getting organized and di d get myself set up fairly well moving forward.
	- ### Three Positives
		- Personal Life
		- Got contacted about a couple jobs
		- Started figuring out some projects that I need to focus on
	- ### Things To Improve
		- Focused work sessions
		- Boot.dev
		- Sticking to working on projects without tutorials. Book tutorials are ok because there's substance, but no tutorials in Sprint 3
			- I have an idea to fix this...
