# September 8, 2024 - Sunday
- Today is the start of a new sprint and I think this time I am going to be more mindful in my approach so I can stay on topic and be more productive. I want to put a major focus on planning and execution, and less on tools and all that. I am going to use Asana and Obsidian primarily, maybe a little help from Notion. Mainly because I want more insight for makin my Pomodoro tool, but also because I love all the tools.
- I've had really poor productivity the last few days for a multitude of reasons, but I am really going to lock in and focus for this week because money needs to start flowing in. I want to put more of an emphasis on focus - more focused goals, more focused tasks, and more focused learning. We'll see how this approach pans out.
