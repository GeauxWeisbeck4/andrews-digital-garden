- # October 16, 2024 - Wednesday
	- Today is starting off with a good intensity and focus. Right when I sat down at my computer, I instantly started getting to work on my digital garden. I need to get version 0.0.1 out today at the very least and start working in public. Gotta add some more projects to my resume site and applying for jobs - its getting way too cold and  I don't wanna be out in the cold again this year. I'm going to also focus on content, because that has been slacking for quite some time now. I'm gonna make it the first order of business in my focus session today. Get a Hashnode post out, start keeping a dev journal, write on Medium, and get newsletters going.
