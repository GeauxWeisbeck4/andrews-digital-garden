	- It is beginning to get fucking cold out and it sucks. I hate this time of year honestly now that we're here. I forget how hard it is to wake up in the morning and get moving when its this cold. At least when its hot out you can sort of just get up and go - yes you're hot and sweaty, but at least it isn't this fucking cold. It's crazy to think that humans lived through ice ages, that any animal has done that. I wonder how bad that has to suck, with it just being freezing for like 100 years or thousands of years or whatever. "Winter is coming." I guess. Maybe that's what is in store for us soon with nuclear weapons being threatened all the time. Well, we'll find out how cold it's going to get before too long, but I have a strong feeling its going to be a really cold winter this year.
