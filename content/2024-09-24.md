# September 24, 2024 - Tuesday
- Well, yesterday was absolutely terrible, got nothing done and felt like shit. I'll have more on that at some point I'm sure, but today needs to be a really positive and productive compared to the bullshit that happened yesterday. Not entirely my fault, but could've done better really. I need to do a lot for Tar Heel Dev Studio, a lot of learning, and work on projects. I'm going to start strong early in the morning probably because I don't know if I'll be sleeping tonight. I need to finish my digital garden, aka porch.
- Gonna go ahead and get started though - later.
