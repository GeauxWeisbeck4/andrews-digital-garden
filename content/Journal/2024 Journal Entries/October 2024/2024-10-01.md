- # October 1, 2024 - Tuesday
	- I was contacted on LinkedIn about a DOT job that is looking for 5 years of experience with somebody who has a lot of experience working with Vue.js and Quasar. I need to make a big pivot today, master Vue and Quasar together and put some projects up showing that I know what I'm doing. off to work.
