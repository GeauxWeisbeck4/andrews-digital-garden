- # October 3rd, 2024 - Thursday
	- Well today has been interesting so far. Really, I'd go as far as calling it a pretty damn good day so far. Hold, BRB, brb. That was bathroom break, be right back btw - by the way. So I had a groggy start to the morning with my eyeballs feeling glued to the back of eyelids. I slunk outta bed with Lisa and zombie walked our way to breakfast at St. Joseph's this morning. After a painful bus ride to the clinic due to missing our dose yesterday, we had a counseling session with our respective counselors. After that, our friend gave us a ride to Panera and I have struggled to get (I typed get my shoes lol) my focus right and work on what I need to. But while searching aimlessly on the web and reading things, I found some pretty neat tools that would be cool in neature. Not really, but they are cool tools. 
	- I need to let my feet pound the pavement and get to work now, I'll potentially have more about this shit later on.
