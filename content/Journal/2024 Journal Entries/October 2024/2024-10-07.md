- # October 7, 2024 - Monday
	- Today is going to be a big day - kind of an important one really. I need to get on track with business stuff, programming, and also organizing and planning my weeks well. Things hopefully are about to get really busy in a good way. I want to keep up this finding stuff and reselling it, both online and in person. This weekend was really fun selling stuff and I caught the bug - I don't want to stop. We could totally get a decent bit of money up doing this if we stay committed and focused to it. I'm going to start working on a store for sure today for Lisa and I, get Andrew the documents and wireframe, and get Tim and Heather started with the stuff I told them I'd help them with. 
	- I'm so excited for what's in store, but I don't want to let the momentum slip at all. Need to stay focused, committed, and positive and things will all work out.
