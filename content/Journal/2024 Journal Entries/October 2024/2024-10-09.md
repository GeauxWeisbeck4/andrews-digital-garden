	- This really is kind of more like starting over from scratch except this time I am absolutely confident in the direction this is headed - my hard work will pay off because of my intense focus, grit, and I refuse to give up on growing my brand.

  

It's been nearly 22 months of going through a housing crisis with my best friend and soulmate - I have so much to say about this amazing person, but that is for another time in my newsletter. We have had so many experiences that most people will never have, some terrible and others beautiful. I have seen some of the worst in people and you'd be surprised to hear that it's not always from people I've met in the street - honestly, I've some of the most raw and honest connections with people who I felt I could never relate to.
