# August 27 2024 - Tuesday
- Well couldn't exactly get home last night so we stayed right around the Panera where I am at working right now. Yesterday was an awful day for me and somewhat of a setback I'd say. I need to get on my grind and get to work, so it's not going to be a terribly long morning page today. 
- I feel like I'm ready to start to really pushing for some interviews. I need to get some real project time in today, but I'm also going to dedicate some solid time to Boot.dev as well. Going to stick some time to system design, data structures, and algorithms. Need to hit those computer science principles, but also need to practice problems and build projects. Just a lot to do period.
