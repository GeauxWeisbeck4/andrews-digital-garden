# August 31, 2024
- Today was the final day of the month and its marking the end of what I would call a month of moving towards something new. A lot happened, but I think I really have put myself in a position where I am ready to start making money from coding finally. Good money I mean.
- Nebraska also seems... different. Like lots better and I think I'm actually really excited about the future and where things are headed for this program. Rhule has made being a Husker fan awesome again. I don't want to jinx us and have it just end up being a fucking shit show after this, but hey, if we beat Colorado then we have very good reason to be sufficiently jacked about this season.
