# August 24, 2024 - Saturday
- Today is going to be a brief morning pages session because there is a lot I need to get going on right away. A couple things to note for my pages is that I am getting to the end of my Boot.dev month subscription and need to figure out how to afford another month. On top of that, I need to look into Section School scholarship funding again. Finally, I have two website goals today - get the resume site up and out as well as get my dev journal published.
