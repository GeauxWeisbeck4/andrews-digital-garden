# August 22, 2024 - Thursday
- This is going to count as my deep focus journal entry for the day. In the future I am going to plan for this to be a little more formal and it will also receive more time and effort, but today I am stretching my productivity time a little thin and I need to put as much time as I possibly can into Boot.dev before my subscription runs out in about 9 days or so. 
- As I make my final push to learning as much as I can from Boot.dev, I want to really start going after jobs with a new veracity in the coming weeks. This will mean a lot of intense studying, multiple job applications, and a need to develop a workflow for maximizing productivity. There's going to be the end of dicking around with things and going on endless rabbit hole deep dives into learning about Prisma or some other tool. There will be deep focus sessions on computer science topics and hundreds of programming interview problems with a lot of reading and note card creation of system design and architecture topics. After really diving deep into data structures and algorithms, I will need to make a huge push in learning machine learning and ai - it is inevitable that I will be creating AI apps at any place I end up working.
- My morning writing session has taken on a newly found urgency to get back in the practice of free flow writing and just getting my thoughts out onto the screen or on paper, depending on how I decide to implement the practice. This idea comes from [Julia Cameron's, The Artist's Way](https://juliacameronlive.com/the-artists-way/) which was a very influential book in my life. I am going to explore that book again in the coming days and write more about it for others while incorporating it's methods into my own workflow and practice.
