# August 30, 2024 - Friday
- Well we're getting to the end of the month and unfortunately, I'm afraid it is most likely that I am going to lose my Boot.dev subscription. I really was hoping that I could hang onto it, but I really don't know if that is going to be possible unless they decide to be kind and help me out in some way. Oh well, I guess I can focus on working on other things.

# Ideas
- ## Pomodoro Planner Project
	- A Pomodoro planner that features a timer, a calendar to plan sessions, a task board, and a journal for you to reflect on what you have accomplished.
	- First I want to build just a basic concept - Timer, journal, To Do list and then add on from there.
- ## Andrew's Digital Garden
	- I just need to create my own digital garden finally
	- Build a plugin for Obsidian to Digital Garden
- ## Django CFB Application
	- Need to restart this but it will be cool
	- Add polls
- üçÖ (pomodoro::WORK) (duration:: 40m) (begin:: 2024-08-30 16:29) - (end:: 2024-08-30 17:09)
