- # September 27, 2024 - Friday
	- Today is Friday and it's been a fucking week and its not close to over yet. It's supposed to keep raining through Sunday. It's been raining non-stop, a bunch of bullshit is going on everywhere all at once. I need to get marketing going on Tar Heel Dev Studio. Writing content needs to get happened. I've gotta kick it into high gear today no matter what.
	- I'm getting started with a very early focus session today and want to see how it goes.
