# September 26, 2024 - Thursday
- Today needs to be one of the most productive days I've ever had. Life has taken a hold on my productivity and it is killing me. I need to get back into my flow I had a month ago - I was unstoppable with how much I was getting done. Today that begins with Tar Heel Dev Studio and I will start building my portfolio from the ground up. I need to think of some creative avenues for marketing and selling my services. I need to get the site deployed so I can start marketing and building up on version 3.
