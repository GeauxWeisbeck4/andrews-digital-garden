# September 3, 2024 - Tuesday
- I'm getting the day kicked off at 4:40 AM right now, sitting outside of Moe's working on this morning page so I can get a head start on the day. Charging up the phone, computer, and battery pack so Lisa will be happy and I can continue to work on the bus on the way to the clinic and wherever we end up going after that. Today is important as the last few days weren't spent very productively, but I understand the reasons why. One of those reasons very well was due to burnout I believe. 
- I have been risking burnout for quite some time now. I have been so focused on trying to learn everything that I haven't been focusing on getting really good at the things people are hiring for. Python, Typescript, Java, Go Lang - I need to master at least one and make it a point that I am really good with the technology so I can get hired for a job. That was advice I got from Primeagon's channel. So we'll continue to focus on getting better at Python and Typescript while also working on Data Structures and Algorithms plus computer science. I think I have the capability to work somewhere, but I need to highlight my skills better so I can convince somebody to hire me.
- In the meantime, I need to continue to push out projects and especially get focused on content now. I haven't been pushing content out at the rate that I've liked to. I think that can be a good area to attack this morning with a couple of projects I want to focus on. One is my Django blog and another is to start on those Backend projects. I like my idea to record me doing the backend projects to see if that catches on at all. It will at least show my trying to power through building something which hopefully will inspire an employer to take a chance on me. 
- Alright, well I've got a plan for some things to work on, time to get started!

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to submit my application for the Junior Web Developer position with SmartRecruiters. With over three years of experience working as a freelance full-stack web developer, I think you will find that I am reasonably qualified for this role. I have worked with APIs, developed custom CMS solutions, and used HTML and JavaScript to create easy-to-use web interfaces. 

I also believe that I bring some unique capabilities to this role that the average candidate may not possess. I have spent over a decade working in various business and marketing positions where I have been able to develop effective communication, customer service, and teamwork skills that have been invaluable in every role I've been in. In every role I have also used my strengths as a problem solver to overcome challenges that required unconventional methods and critical thought.

You will find my resume of qualifications and experiences attached to this application which will demonstrate my capability to do all the necessary tasks required of this role. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to email me at andrew.weisbeck@gmail.com or call me at 919-638-6663. 

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards, 

Andrew Weisbeck
