# September 18, 2024 - Wednesday
- So I think that I have been using too many ways of not pushing myself to my full potential and challenging myself enough in my programming daily. This is going to be a hard pattern to break out of, but I really need to get outside of my comfort zone. I really need to officially start my 10 Leet Code problems a day and focus on learning data structures and algorithms. The Roadmap is a great way to get going on that, so I think that will be something I pair in with reading my OReilly books tonight and in the morning. I should be able to sit down and try to figure out how to build something, like the Pomodoro Journal or my digital garden, without having to sit and look at a tutorial or source code to make it exactly like something that's already been made. If I want to take the next step as a programmer, I am going to need to do these sort of things. I need to make my daily notes more learning from creating them and not just an exercise of getting them done, just to be fucking checking a box off. There needs to be some data collection and then some stats compiled and some graphs created to tell a story that helps me become better each day.
