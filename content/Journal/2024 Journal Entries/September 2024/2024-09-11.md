- # September 11, 2024 - Wednesday
	- I've got a lot to do today, but I'd like to take a moment and reflect on 9/11 and everything that has taken place since. It really was an attack that changed the world. It really was an attack on the entire free world and not just on New York, the United States, but any democracy who has fought for its freedom. Terrorism took on a whole new level of destruction; Media realized how much money was to be made in the terrorism business.
