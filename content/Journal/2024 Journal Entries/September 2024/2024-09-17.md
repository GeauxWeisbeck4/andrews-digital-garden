# September 17, 2024 - Tuesday
- Today really started out really shitty. We were waiting on somebody to get back all morning and we got dumped on, non-stop. They didn't end up coming until about 3:00 and the whole time until then we were wet, cold, and felt not great. Things got quite a bit better after they showed up. Working at Barnes and Noble now trying to stay dry.
- Yeah, today pretty much started out as brutal as you can imagine with the pouring wet rain and no good dry clothes for when I made it back to the tent. I think having such a horrible day that I was brought to tears at one point was something that may be a good kick in the ass for Lisa and I in trying to change our situation. We have been stagnant in doing the things we need to do really to get out of the tent. I think if we can get the computer back, start looking for jobs and clients seriously, then we can really take some big steps towards getting out of this shit fuck situation. I don't even doubt it that we can do it one bit. It's just going to take some hard work and patience.
