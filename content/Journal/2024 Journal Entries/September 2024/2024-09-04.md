# September 4, 2024 - Wednesday
- I hope we can have a good productive day and I can figure out how to start bringing some dollar bills in. I really need to find a consistent income stream until I can start full time work, even like $500 a week would be plenty to survive on right now. Express Writers is a good option I need to look back into, meaning I also need to get some content out there ASAP.
- Coding wise I need to get back on track with some projects, like my College Football blog and then start challenging myself with some builds outside of using tutorials and resources. I also need to spend some time with DSA to get more familiar with solving problems using data structures and algorithms. I think a good goal for each day would be to solve 10 Coding Wars problems and maybe 5 Leet code problems? I think that would get me in the drivers seat pretty quickly with mastering programming.
- I need to start recording the projects where I just start from scratch with nothing but my editor and maybe a drawing tool or diagramming tool - I know, my editor and Obsidian! That will be real growth and I think capturing it on camera would be worth a million bucks really. It would at least get me good enough to where I could start creating a course and actually selling it to people. I still think I am on track to reach my $100 goal, I just need to be flexible in how I earn my money. It might not even be from my coding capabilities,  but rather the things that separate me from other coders will be important to highlight so employers will see me more than just another coder on the team.
- Lots of content needs to start pouring out of my brain and into articles, social media posts, and into coding ideas.
