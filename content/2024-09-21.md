# September 21, 2024 - Saturday
- Today is going to be a very busy day as I am playing a lot of catch up but there is also a lot good that is going on. Going to really try to go to the Django Girls meetup for Lisa and get my studio site up and out there. I hope she has a good time and it opens her eyes to what is possible and how fun that Web Development can really be. If she'll let me, I'm going to walk here through some things before she goes so she can impress the others.
