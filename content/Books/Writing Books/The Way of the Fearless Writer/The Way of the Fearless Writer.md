description: A new, mindful approach to the writing life In a radical departure from standard advice about creative success, effort, critique, and competition, The Way of the Fearless Writer will show you that there is another way to thriveâ€”a writing path of ease, trust, wonder, and joy. You are invited to embark on a sacred writing journey. Along the way, author Beth Kempton will teach you how to free your mind so your body can create, transform your relationship to fear, write anytime, anywhere, and share your words with confidence. Being a fearless writer has little to do with validation and accolades. Rather it is about ritual, commitment, developing an acute awareness of beauty, dancing with inspiration, listening to the world outside yourself and going deep within. The Way of the Fearless Writer is your guide to this creative, transformational journey. This is not just a book about how to write better. It's a book about how to live better, with your heart as your compass and writing as your guide. Offering rare insight into the writing life and a host of fresh and original writing exercises, The Way of the Fearless Writer will reveal your true potential, and open your eyes to writing as a direct connection to life itself.
