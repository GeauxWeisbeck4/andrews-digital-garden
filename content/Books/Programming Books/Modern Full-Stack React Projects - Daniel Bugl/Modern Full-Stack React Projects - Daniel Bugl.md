description: Polish your web development skills by working on real-world projects for different use-cases of full-stack web development Key Features Understand how the different aspects of a MERN application come together through a series of practical projects Set up frontend and backend projects that can be integrated and maintained together Enhance your proficiency in building scalable and sustainable React projects Purchase of the print or Kindle book includes a free PDF eBook Book DescriptionUnderstanding full-stack development is vital as companies aim to bridge the gap between frontend and backend development. Recent trends show deeper integration between the two, opening numerous possibilities for building real-world web applications, through server-side technologies like Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Written by the author of Learning Redux and Learn React Hooks, and CEO of TouchLay, Modern Full-Stack React Projects will guide you through the entire process of advancing from a frontend developer to a full-stack developer. Starting with how to set up robust projects that can be maintained for a long time, you’ll then progress toward developing a backend system and integrating it with the frontend. Throughout the book, you’ll learn how to build, test, and deploy a blog application and a chat application. You’ll also explore MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js (MERN) stack, best practices for frontend and backend development, different full-stack architectures, unit and end-to-end testing, and deployment of full-stack web applications. Once you get to grips with the essential concepts, you’ll progress to learn how to use Next.js, an enterprise-grade full-stack web framework for React. By the end, you’ll be well-versed in the MERN stack and all set to create performant and scalable full-stack web applications. What you will learn Implement a backend using Express and MongoDB, and unit-test it with Jest Deploy full-stack web apps using Docker, set up CI/CD and end-to-end tests using Playwright Add authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) Create a GraphQL backend and integrate it with a frontend using Apollo Client Build a chat app based on event-driven architecture using Socket.IO Facilitate Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and implement server-side rendering Use Next.js, an enterprise-ready full-stack framework, with React Server Components and Server Actions Who this book is for This book is for frontend developers, JavaScript engineers, and React developers who possess a solid understanding of JavaScript and React concepts. Specifically designed for those with limited experience in the development, creation, integration, and deployment of backend and full-stack systems, this book will equip you with the necessary skills to create high-quality web applications.
