- # September 19, 2024
	- I'm quite tired this morning for many different reasons but the main reason is that it is so cold at night and it is hard to sleep at night with the freezing cold temperatures. It's going to take some getting used to but we'll get used to it before too long. The buddy heater is gonna have to come back out - It's me and Lisa's favorite thing we own. Kinda funny isn't it?
	- Got to get to work - enough time wasted falling asleep at the computer.
