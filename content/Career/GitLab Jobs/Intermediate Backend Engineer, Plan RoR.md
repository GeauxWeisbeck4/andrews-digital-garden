# Intermediate Backend Engineer, Plan RoR

GitLab is an open core software company that develops the most comprehensive [AI-powered DevSecOps Platform](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/devops-platform), used by more than 100,000 organizations. Our [mission](https://about.gitlab.com/company/mission) is to enable everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world. When everyone can contribute, consumers become contributors, significantly accelerating the rate of human progress. This mission is integral to our culture, influencing how we hire, build products, and lead our industry. We make this possible at GitLab by running our [operations](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/using-gitlab-at-gitlab) on our product and staying aligned with our [values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values). Learn more about [Life at GitLab](https://vimeo.com/gitlab/gettoknowgitlab).

At GitLab, developers are independent and self-organized individual contributors who work together as a tight team in a [remote and agile](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/09/14/remote-agile-at-gitlab/) way.

Most backend developers work on all aspects of GitLab, building features, fixing bugs, and generally improving the application.  The responsibilities of the Plan team are described by the [Plan stage](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#plan-stage). Among other things, this means working on GitLab’s functionality around issues, boards, milestones, to-do list, issue lists and filtering, roadmaps, time tracking, requirements management, notifications, value stream analytics (VSA), wiki, and pages.

The Plan stage is currently hiring for 3 separate teams. We will assess your skillsets against all 3 teams to determine best fit.

**Product Planning:**

The Product Planning group at GitLab is responsible for developing enterprise agile planning solutions that empower large engineering divisions to plan their work efficiently. Our distributed team leverages Ruby on Rails to build scalable, high-performance features that are seamlessly integrated into the GitLab product. We drive the adoption of modern technologies such as GraphQL and optimize the handling of extensive issue data within our PostgreSQL databases. By collaborating closely with product managers, designers, and engineers across various regions, we shape the strategic direction of our feature suite, enhancing functionalities like epics, roadmaps, and agile workflows, all through the use of our new work items framework. We prioritize innovation, continuous learning, and direct collaboration with our customers, providing opportunities to solve complex challenges and make a significant impact on millions of users.

**Project Management:**

The Project Management group at GitLab is responsible for developing cutting-edge project management solutions that empower teams worldwide. Our distributed team leverages Ruby on Rails to build scalable, high-performance features seamlessly integrated into the GitLab product. We drive the adoption of modern technologies such as GraphQL and optimize the handling of extensive issue data within our PostgreSQL databases. By collaborating closely with product managers, designers, and engineers across various regions, we shape the strategic direction of our project management suite, enhancing functionalities like issue tracking, milestone planning, and agile workflows, all through the use of our new work items framework. We prioritize innovation, continuous learning, and direct collaboration with our customers, providing opportunities to solve complex challenges and make a significant impact on millions of users.

**Knowledge:**

[Knowledge](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/dev/plan/knowledge/) is a small team owning GitLab Wiki, GitLab Pages, and everything related to markdown and text editing in GitLab. Our next focus is transforming GitLab Wiki from a simple Git wrapper to a fully-featured knowledge management solution with search, intuitive navigation, comments, permissions, etc. We also maintain GitLab Pages - a very popular static website hosting solution written in Go, focusing on ensuring high availability and performance. And we manage markdown features across GitLab, powered by a Rust-based parser, adding dynamic capabilities like link expansions and more.

###  **Responsibilities**

- Develop features and improvements to the GitLab product in a secure, well-tested, and performant way

- Conduct [Code Review](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/code-review/) within our [Code Review Guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/code_review.html) and ensure community contributions receive a swift response.
- Recognize impediments to our efficiency as a team ("technical debt"), propose and implement solutions
- Represent GitLab and its values in public communication around specific projects and community contributions.
- Confidently ship small features and improvements with minimal guidance and support from other team members. Collaborate with the team on larger projects.
- Participate in Tier 2 or Tier 3 weekday and weekend and occasional night [on-call rotations](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/processes/Infra-Dev-Escalation/process.html) to assist troubleshooting product operations, security operations, and urgent engineering issues.

- Demonstrated capacity to clearly and concisely communicate about complex technical, architectural, and/or organizational problems and propose thorough iterative solutions
