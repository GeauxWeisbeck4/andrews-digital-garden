# Intermediate Backend Engineer - Foundations: Import and Integrate

#### **An overview of this role**

As a Backend Engineer at GitLab, _you_ are pivotal in shaping how users manage and integrate their GitLab workspaces. Your work will impact our open-source community and enterprise customers by enhancing our product, GitLab.com, and the enterprise editions. You’ll collaborate closely with product managers, designers, and front-end engineers to build solutions that empower teams worldwide to seamlessly import data from competitor tools and manage access while adhering to strict compliance standards.

You'll join the [Import & Integrate team](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/dev/foundations/import-and-integrate/) under the [Foundations stage](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/dev/foundations/), where _you_ will tackle complex challenges like ensuring smooth data migration and helping users adopt GitLab’s DevOps processes effectively. Your work here allows teams to accelerate their DevOps journey, manage value streams, and optimize workflows. The [roadmap](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/foundations/import_and_integrate/) includes refining integrations, improving user access control, and enhancing the end-to-end DevOps experience.

As part of a [remote-first, global company](https://about.gitlab.com/company/all-remote/), you will have a unique opportunity to collaborate with peers across different time zones and cultures while reporting directly to a stable and supportive team. Your contributions will directly and visibly impact GitLab’s vast and growing user community. Whether based in the AMER, EMEA, or APAC regions, this role offers the flexibility to drive change from wherever you are.

Some examples of our projects: 

- [GitLab project migration and automation](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/01/18/try-out-new-way-to-migrate-projects/)
- [Direct Transfer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVQ6Ex9fSl8) 
- [Importers](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/manage/import_and_integrate/importers/)
- [Integrations](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/manage/import_and_integrate/integrations/)
- [Webhook](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/manage/import_and_integrate/webhooks/)
- [API](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/manage/import_and_integrate/api/)

**What You’ll Do**  

- Develop features and improvements to the GitLab product in a secure, well-tested, and performant way
- Collaborate with Product Management and other stakeholders within Engineering (Frontend, UX, etc.) to maintain a high bar for quality in a fast-paced, iterative environment
- Advocate for improvements to product quality, security, and performance
- Solve technical problems of moderate scope and complexity.
- Craft code that meets our internal standards for style, maintainability, and best practices for a high-scale web environment.
- Conduct a [code review](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/code-review/) within our [code review guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/code_review.html) and ensure that community contributions receive a swift response.
- Recognize impediments to our efficiency as a team (“technical debt”), propose and implement solutions
- Represent GitLab and its values in public communication around specific projects and community contributions.
- Confidently ship small features and improvements with minimal guidance and support from other team members. Collaborate with the team on larger projects.
- Participate in Tier 2 or Tier 3 weekday and weekend and occasional night [on-call rotations](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/processes/infra-dev-escalation/process/) to assist troubleshooting product operations, security operations, and urgent engineering issues.

**What You’ll Bring** 

- Significant professional experience with Ruby on Rails, Redis, and Sidekiq
- Professional experience with Rest API, GraphQL, and Postgres SQL
- Experience with Data Migration, Grafana, and Kibana preferred
- Proficiency in the English language, both written and verbal, is sufficient for success in a remote and largely asynchronous work environment.
- Demonstrated capacity to clearly and concisely communicate about complex technical, architectural, and/or organizational problems and propose thorough iterative solutions.
- Experience with performance and optimization problems and a demonstrated ability to both diagnose and prevent these problems.
- Comfort working in a highly agile, intensely iterative software development process.
- An inclination towards communication, inclusion, and visibility.
- Experience owning a project from concept to production, including proposal, discussion, and execution.
- Self-motivated and self-managing, with excellent organizational skills.
- Demonstrated ability to work closely with other parts of the organization.
- Share our values, and work in accordance with those values.
- Ability to thrive in a fully remote organization.
